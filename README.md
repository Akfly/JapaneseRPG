### Roadmap

#### Version 0.1
- [x] Main Menu
- [ ] Game scene with different game modes:
	- [ ] Kanji to Pronunciation to Meaning
	- [ ] Meaning to Pronunciation
	- [ ] Meaning to Kanji
	- [ ] Random
- [ ] Save scores
- [ ] Add all words from book 1 (more vocabulary will be included while developing)
- [ ] Add english database

#### Version 0.2
Add battle system. Different characters will fight against monsters, as a Final Fantasy game, but the attack will only hit if the user answers a minigame correctly. More attacks will be introduced while developing, so this version will have only a few attacks (normal, 1 attack per element, 1 special/turbo/whatever, 1 ranged, 1 cure).

#### Version 0.3
Add leveling system. Wining battles will level up the heroes. Increasing their stats

#### Version 0.4
Add item and save system. Wining battles will drop items to use in-battle and equipment for characters. More items will be introduced while developing, so only a few items will be created on this version. Save will store character data (score data was already done in a previous version).

#### Version 0.5
Improve graphics

#### Version 0.6
Add Sentence minigame. Complete a sentence generated randomly under some rules. The idea is to keep improving this minigame while developing other features, so this version will have really simple sentences only.

#### Version 0.7
Writing check. The user will write in kanji and hiragana a word (for example 食べました). This will be self-checked by the user. After completing the word, an image with stroke order and direction will appear. Maybe in the future it will be checked automatically, but not before version 1.0.

#### Version 0.8
Add possibility for the user to include/create their own books. It's a CSV, so the user will have to create that CSV and upload to the game.

#### Version 0.9
Add in-game store (in-game coins). Probably add more items.

#### Version 0.10
Add more attacks/items/words. Improve sentence... etc

#### Version 0.11
Android support

#### Version 0.12
PC support

#### Version 1.0
Fix bugs and release

#### Version 1.1
Add dungeon system

#### Version 1.2
Add more attacks/items/words. Improve sentence... etc
